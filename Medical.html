<center><h3><li><strong> Scanning Equipment : </h3></strong> <p>Scanning equipment such as MRI and X-rays have been tremendous 
types of technology that have had a positive impact on society. Using them, we can detect any possible damage to certain organs and muscles, or check if there has been a fracture of a bone.</p>

<center><h3><li><strong> Simulations : </h3></strong><p>Simulations can be used for medical purposes, by giving the medical staff,an idea of how a certain situation could play out. This can also be used to figure out how quickly

<center><h3><li><strong> Surgery: </h3></strong><p> Surgery has recently started to take a big leap in advancements, with the introduction of surgical robotics. The surgeon still controls the robot froma  machine, but the 
advantage of using these surgical machines, is that they provide much better accuracy. This precision means, that it is less likely for the surgeon to make a mistake, and machines can allow the surgeons to squeeze into tight 
spaces, meaning the patient doesn't need to have huge incisions. </li></center>
